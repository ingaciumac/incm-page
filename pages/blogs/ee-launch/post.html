		<p>part 1: why we build the EE app shop<br/>
			EE app - how it started<br/>
			EE is one of the leading mobile providers in UK counting over 22m customers.<br/>
			EE customers can access their services through their website account or through the EE app.<br/>
			Today the EE app is contributing with approximately 40% of orders and has a the total traffic and has around 450K weekly visits.<br/>
			When I moved to UK in 2019 the EE app was a static page showing your data usage. For any tasks a customer might've intent to use the app, there was a break to web link opening the EE website in your phone browser.
			I joined EE in 2022. This was the beginning of launching the new EE app with native experiences.<br/>
			The team I joined was in charge of launching the shop experience in the app. This was the first app native experience followed by all other app areas. Our team was the first to release using a totally new technology, Flutter, which allowed to have one development team, instead of having iOS and Android platform based teams. I was a witness (and active contributor) to how the app experience changed from showing customers embedded web pages (or breaking to web browser) to gradually become fully native and truly usable.<br/>
			The importance of a shop experience in the EE app<br/>
			The importance of launching the shop experience in the app was to allow any exiting mobile customer to upgrade their mobile plans or buy new plans. Even though checking the bills or activating roaming might seem to be the main use cases of the app, shop experience was no. 1 business priority being the only area in the app to generate profit within the app at the initial stage, therefor allowing to prioritise its development.
			Also considering the continuously increase of use of mobile phones made the company to rethink their strategy by expanding on platforms that are mostly used by customer.
			Worth mentoring a few pivotal business goals: merge BT and EE (BT Broadband becomes one of EE products, EE becoming the customer facing company while BT will become a B to B) and as a result of this merge to expand on the services portfolio and “win the household” market by enabling not just broadband and mobile connection, but also all sort of products that can emerge
			In long term vision, the shop would become a marketplace. The tactical approach was to bring into the shop existing services to allow time for customers to familiarise and use the shop, as well as the company to learn from building first app experiences considering the new technologies (the use of Flutter for front end and transition of the backend platform from an old systems to new e-commerce solutions).</p>

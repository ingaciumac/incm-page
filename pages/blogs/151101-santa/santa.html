		<h1>Santa Clause<br/>was there</h1>
		<h2>This article was written for NOUA Magazine, #2 edition “Neighbours”, organized by FROH! Publish Yourself, Chisinau, Moldova – Kiev, Ukraine<br/>
		November  2015</h2>
		<p>It was winter of 2014. All the media channels were invaded and overflowed by news from Kyiv and  <span class="underline">painful consequences of Maidan</span>. We decided to lunch together. I think it happened only once before. Normally, we’d see each other in the evenings, once or twice a week. Filled with terror, everybody made their guesses about the way things might evolve in Kyiv. What if it escalated? We’re next door!<br/><br/>
		- You know what I’m thinking about? What if tomorrow Transnistria joined Russia? Would it mean that I am sleeping with an enemy? - he wondered.
		- Yeah. Then you’d better not sleep tight for you may be attacked at night. Please take me to Columna Street, I need to buy some placticine…<br/><br/> 
		I caught myself cheekily lying to change the subject, pretending that I am really not interested in those political issues... or at least that they interest me no more than the plasticine I needed for work.</p>
		<h2 class="devider">.  .  .</h2>
		<p>Sometimes I wonder how come that I, a person always conflicting with myself as any person from Transnistria, ended up working in Chisinau, in one of the most bright and creative advertising agency, declaring love and peace as core values. It still feels weird to me and, honestly speaking, I have to try hard not to let this feeling show up and be a part of the team.
		When in high school I could not stand those patriotic pills we were daily fed with anymore. Those years of daily commuting to school got all things confused in my head.<br/><br/>
		To make things clearer, let's look some decades back. In the USSR we all had to use the cyrilic alphabet as all other Soviet republics, however educators in Transnistrian schools insisted that Transnistrian kids had to be educated by all-Moldovan education curriculum as the rest Moldovan children, which meant switching to the Latin alphabet. A number of attempts had failed by 1996, and this was the year of the last try and... the year I went to school. I can still remember my first school day when I approached my school, I saw armed men with police dogs at the closed entrance door.
		Thus... while Moldovan children of my age were enjoying dance classes and visiting libraries, we were standing in front of the Russian Embassy with placards, holding them high and tight, demanding our Latin script back. We were just happy to see Chisinau for the first time. We were kids. We were no activists.<br/> <br/>
		The five years of secretly studying in the Latin script, participating in protests and applying to different human rights organisation finally resulted in the Order by the Minister of Education allowing Transnistrian children to study at Moldovan schools by the Moldovan curriculum. In Romanian. Using the Latin script. As the rest Moldovan school children. We got a choice, either to continue studying in cyrilic in Transnistria, or in latin in Moldova. This meant dozens of kilometers to commute every day, studying in the second shift, after the local kids finished their classes and left home. Althogether there were five such Transnistrian schools which shared premises with five Moldovan hosting schools.<br/><br/>
		The local kids in hosting schools were not happy about having us around at all. They weren’t eager to share their ‘sacred’ place of knowledge. They confronted us like real… kids: they crept to our buses in the darness to at least throw at us a stick, a tomato or… sometimes even a stone. That was their way of demonstrating their displeasure for us ‘occupying’ their school. Once they succeeded in their attempts and broke a window of our bus, the crashed glass scattered all over. Luckily, none of us was hurt, only a teacher got some scratches. But... The penny dropped... They felt it couldn’t go on like that. They took pity on us and declared a 'ceasefire'. In 8th and 9th grades we were already good friends, sharing the same school festive events.<br/><br/>
		In the meantime, the village roads were repaired and the school was reconditioned. All relating to those schools won a privileged status because, yes, we were a bunch of kids who made a noble choice despite all risks – to follow our Romanian Language and History. To be honest, it was our parents’ and teachers’ decision. For what a 7 year old child could know about patriotism?<br/><br/>
		“At home you may speak whichever language you like! I will hear no Russian word here. I will not let all the effort we've made to be here go down the drain!” – the teachers could be heard grumbling in the school hallways.
		Obviously, at home, we were under the influence of the Russian language. I mean my yard friends and mass media. Everything except school had Russian footprint, even the New Year. First we celebrated it at 11:00 after addressing to folk of the Russian president, then at 12:00 by local time. It was tradition: I was running to the window at 11:00 looking at fireworks. Then I was running to the window at 12:00 and looking at fireworks again. Hm, why not? Beautiful things can be seen twice.<br/><br/>
		I was approaching the age where the taste is defined. I was about 16 years old. I was beginning to choose the music. Tapes of <em>Bi-2, Chicherina, Splin.</em> I liked the music somewhere, somewhere I was discovering types of people who inspired me, because I had all sorts of kid inquiries which I was completing with my friends (mostly Russians) from the yard and there were questions such as: "What is your favorite music?" "Who do you like?", "Favorite color?", etc. Also with yard friends we were making rounds on all creative circles in the city. I remember how even my brother with two more boys were enrolled with us girls in the yard at crocheting. Because we were holding together somehow and if you were drawing paper dolls - then the entire courtyard joined you.<br/><br/>
		So, my life visions had no common points with the values that had been promoted at school. Rather I shared them with my yard friends. And we nowhere have in our kid inquiries such a question like "What is you favorite language?”.<br/><br/>
		In the last years of school I had not listened to my teachers and their's demagogies. As long as they tried to infiltrate the idea of language importance and patriotism as more I was detesting much more the context in which I was. I felt in love then of the word duality. When I was pronouncing that word I was filling with proud. Like if it was invented by me.<br/><br/>
		I was happy when I finished school and moved to Chișinău. Now I think I would be even happier if I had told everyone I was Russian, just to avoid being bombarded with questions about my personal attitude to Transnistria. My very personal and pragmatic conviction on the matter is that people in there are still under the Russian influence so much that there is hardly a chance of willingly joining Moldova. The ethnicity is an extremely complex issue, all Transnistrians should change blood to ever feel Moldovans, or even more – Romanians, as there had been something else flowing through their veins for far too long.<br/><br/>
		Actually no! Today I feel almost local in Chişinău. I love what I do and how things go here. Except of those from the Great National Assembly Square... I feel insecure and afraid, and this feelings go inside under my skin ... lately I became again sensitive on the political chapter. Because I recently reassessed the past:<br/><br/>
		Such as the time when the civil war was going on…<br/><br/>
		Once the funeral of a member of the National Moldovan Front was passing through Grigoriopol. To instigate disorders, two bombshells (“Alazani” hail devices) were dropped nearby. One of them hit a house - two eldely people died instantly. The other one hit near the kindergarten. It was my kindergarten. I was there then.<br/><br/>
		After what happened, my parents took me and my brother to our grandparents to the North of the country, away from these risks. The first train took us toand Ukraine, where we were to change for another train to our final destination point. The second train stopped at the station and only one door opened. There were many people, they were panicing. My brother and I were thrust inside in the last minute. The train started off. Mom remained outside. We were crying, our faces glued to the window. She was running after the train. In the end, people inside the train grabbed her and pulled her in.<br/><br/>
		I did not know this story until recently. Mom told it only now after my ex-boyfriend’s numerous questions about my origin and political priorities as he wanted to make sure we are sharing the same core values, that I am not his… enemy.<br/><br/>
		I can’t tell whether I am perceived as an enemy just because I avoid discussing political or patriotic issues, but I have gone through such events that discourage me to get into politics at all.
		All I can tell is that I still keep in my memory that I was three-four year old, that it was the New Year’s Eve, our parents were talking about Santa Claus who left my first plush toy for me (Lolo, a black pinguin with his eyes made of buttons). Also I remember standing in a wooden fruit box in the kindergarten’s basement, on the day of the bombshell got next to our kindergarten.<br/><br/>
		All happened too fast. We were barefoot…</p>

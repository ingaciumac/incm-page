		<h1>All logos look the same.</h1>
		<h2>Or how designers lost in the competition with marketing strategists by giving up with the long lasting design solutions.</h2>
		<p>Currently we are facing such a graphic design phase when a lot of brands use to have very similar logos. More exactly, a lot of brands switched from having proper logos to just having logotypes (logos without a symbol) and with no exception all use sans serif geometric fonts.</p>

		<p>I can understand the designers point of view on this matter. For them it is basically a win over that old marketing strategy where you should always design a very unique logo with a symbol in order to be recogniscible. Sometimes this is just an impossible mission - all good basic shapes are already taken, even apples. That's why logos such as Uber or the new rebranded Revolut one, are more than enough for a brand to be successful.</p>
